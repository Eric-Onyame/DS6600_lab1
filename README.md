##Why I chose the MIT License for this project

I have selected the MIT License due to some specific reasons. The MIT License is widely regarded as one of the most permissive and straightforward licenses currently in existence. The license grants individuals the freedom to utilize, alter, disseminate, sublicense, and even engage in commercial transactions using the code. This fosters cooperation and the unrestricted dissemination of ideas. The license also has excellent compatibility with other licenses, hence facilitating seamless integration of my work into the projects of other developers with no worries regarding legal complexities. Furthermore, the MIT License offers a degree of safeguarding against the inappropriate use of my code. Although it grants extensive liberties, the code specifically disclaims any warranty, safeguarding me against legal liabilities of my work. Finally, the MIT License is widely acknowledged and comprehended among the developer community, hence potentially enticing a greater number of contributors to the project. 


##What if No License?

Not providing a license will have some consequences. It can first default the project to full copyright law which implies that others cannot reproduce, distribute or create derivative works from it without explicit permission. It can also lead to some legal uncertainties where other developers will be unsure about the legal consequences of using or contributing to the project. Overall, not having a license creates an environment of uncertainty and legal risk which potentially discourages community involvement, collaboration, and the open exchange of ideas.
